# SNNv-sANN

This project explores the implementation and optimization of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) using the Brian2 simulation library, aimed at processing and classifying MNIST dataset images into spike trains. The initiative also includes a comparative study with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to evaluate performance differences in digit recognition tasks. The goal is to understand and enhance neuron model responses to varying inputs and optimize network parameters for better accuracy and efficiency
